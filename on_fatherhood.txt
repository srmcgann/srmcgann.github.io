On Fatherhood

Nature and evolution are recurring themes in many of my writings, and my description of a "natural" role of human fathers, must begin and end with love.

"Always should be someone you really love" -Blur

Whether love happens "at first sight" or elsewhere in the due process of courtship, love is the basis, glue, and buoyancy of family units, flowing first between boy and girl, "between" being the operative word. Love, in this sense, is neither giving nor taking, but sharing, together experiences including sex, companionship, trust, an instinctive desire to protect, provide for, and just be with. This conglomeration of things and feelings comprises the embryonic "family nucleus," which, per nature, becomes an actual embryo. Following birth (at which fathers should also be present), the new baby becomes part of the whole, sharing in the stable and well-established family by that time.

Specifically, fathers, besides "being there" as much as possible, in spirit, financially, emotionally, and in actuality, have natural roles to protect, teach, lead, entertain, and support in non-obvious ways as needed, all those in their family circle. Additionally, fathers have a responsibility to remain healthy in terms of personal choices and habits, and set an example for their children which defines, to a large extent, their future love interests and personality traits.

Too many fathers are too (or completely) absent. Supplying genetic material alone, may technically define "fatherhood," but just as receiving a paycheck technically makes one an employee, the actual job entails attendance, work, accountability, and under healthy, natural conditions, joy in the process!
