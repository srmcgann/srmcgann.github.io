on survival types


There are many sayings from antiquity used to describe behavior that, under ordinary conditions would constitute impropriety, but in dire situations would be merely prudent. "Come hook or by crook" is one. "Whatever he could beg borrow or steal" another. "Desperate times call for desperate measures." Also, most pointedly, "whatever it takes!"
It's very easy, from relative safety, comfort, and properly-met needs, to look down upon and judge those who would, for example, steal a loaf of bread to feed their starving families, but herein lies a giant misconception that honesty and upright dealings are always best. Ask yourself, who is right - they who would do anything to survive, or they who would choose starvation before trespassing? I know who I would want on my side if ever circumstances became life-threatening.
Absolute morality does not exist. Morality depends wholly on agreed-upon goals, without which it is arbitrary, incomplete, and useless. If our goals, mutually, are to survive as a community, then morality dictates the needs of all must remain a priority. When any member of the community, differently-abled, elderly, or fit as a fiddle, cannot reasonably make ends meet, it is the whole community's problem.
