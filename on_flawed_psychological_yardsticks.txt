on flawed psychological yardsticks


It is tempting, often, to oversimplify testing in science to more easily or quickly arrive at an apparent result. But much care should be taken to ensure that the test is appropriate and fitting to the hypothesis. For example, if we wish  to conclude which, among, a group of strangers at a party an individual is most attracted to, simply ascertaining those to whom our subject gives the most attention would be a na√Øve approach, and illustrates the often flawed reasoning behind some clumsy science. In this case, assuming that those to whom our subject gives the most attention represent attractive people to our subject, does not consider the often counterintuitive cases of behavior in romance. It is always possible that for whatever reason, our subject may feel unprepared or ill-equipped to approach our court the true most-attractive person, and thereby avoid any and all outgoing attention toward this person so as to avoid awkwardness or heartbreak, whether or not such is plausible.

Sometimes the best testing strategy involves first, starting at the outcome (as predicted) then working backward by logical steps, creating the proper test in reverse.
