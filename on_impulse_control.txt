on impulse control


Arguably, all behavioral dysfunction stems from impulse control, or lack thereof. Overeating, substance abuse/addiction, as well as indulging sexual impulses, either cerebrally or in actuality. These and other impulses all represent opportunities to choose action and/or thought which, depending on the circumstances may or may not be appropriate. Healthy behavior patterns always involve deep, reflexive impulse control, without which anyone may fall victim to obesity, unhealthy habits involving pornography, drugs, or anything which triggers sudden desires - even shopping or other seemingly innocuous activities. Learning impulse control is, like developing any habit, a matter of practice, persistence, desire, and repetition. It is ironic that impulse control itself is a habit to control other habits. Recognizing triggers, like suggestive content before they reach the part of the brain that controls action, and deciding to abort the impulse, becomes the impulse.
