On Discrimination

Any campaign that targets the wrong things will eventually be called for reform or removal. The tragedy of the Great Civil Rights movements of the 20th Century were the overzealous, overcorrection of what was and still is, a gross violation of human rights against minority groups. The specific ways in which these movements failed and have legitimately lost credibility, are 1) Equality is an illusion and can never be enforced or respected because it doesn't exist. People are different. If they weren't, we wouldn't be individuals. 2) Antidiscrimination and all laws/policies based on it, is an attack on the ability of individuals and groups to effectively deal with people based on their individual qualities. Discrimination is unavoidable, and absolutely necessary in order to function, and those to whom this fact is obvious are justified to question rules that prohibit discrimination.

Just because you're human doesn't guarantee you an "equal slice." Maybe someone lacks work ethic or the natural abilities required to succeed on an above-average level. Laziness and stupidity are real, however equal opportunity, on the other hand should absolutely be guaranteed. A fair chance or three to get your foot in the door. And of course, basic dignity and access to survival necessities should be universal human rights. Respect that is deserved, fair chances, and a safety net for everyone, should have been the main points in the 60's, 70's and beyond, not enforcement of something that can never exist.
