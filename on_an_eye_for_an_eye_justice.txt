On "Eye for an eye" justice


Many feel comfortable justifying their treatment of others based on the reverse. For example, in an "eye for an eye" justice system, if someone lies to you, there is a defense for a lie you may tell them in return. But herein lies a dangerous pitfall. In this example, the original lie might not have been a lie in spirit or in actuality - speech may be considered true based only on the intended meaning of the speaker, not any random interpretation by the recipient(s). 

So here we have assumed grounds for "justice" when in fact none may exist - and any retaliatory action becomes the impetus for a cyclical, downward spiral of unjust, unjustified injury. And the example of misunderstood  untruth is but one of many which prove that, as Ghandi said, "an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind."

Eye for an eye requires no tolerance or benevolence. No goodwill unto our fellow men and women nor special consideration of others beyond simply avoiding them. It should be obvious that, on a long enough timeline, this system will always fail.

What doesn't fail, or fails less quickly, is promoting a communal spirit of wanting to understand one another, being patient and kind, and never retaliating except as a last resort - and as THE actual last resort.
