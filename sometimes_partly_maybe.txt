"sometimes, partly, maybe"

As some people frequently oversimplify, generalize, stereotype, and group things inappropriately, so too do they struggle with understanding basic duality. For example, "it either does, or it doesn't" is sometimes a valid statement, depending on the subject and context, but this statement does not apply to everything. Individuality is the condition whereby qualities may be said to exist absolutely, or not - and only individuals may possess absolute qualities. Groups may not. To say that "people either like the color blue or don't" referring to people as a whole, is an error of logic and phrasing.
The concepts of "sometimes", "partly", and "maybe" should be incorporated in early education to seed the idea of duality, with emphasis on recognizing the separateness of things when they are. Separateness is as important as connectedness in terms of observation.
As an aside, human emotions, while being of and from individuals, may exhibit duality, the psyche being a collective of countless thoughts and feelings.
