on seeing the possible


Too often we take things at face value, accepting "common knowledge" as truth without checking facts. For example accepting that, in the words of Elon Musk, "carbon based life is analogous to a boot-loader for A.I." (paraphrased), suggesting that simply because AI may be or become smarter than humans, we are doomed somehow, is nowhere given in the facts, and need not be cause for alarm or despair. Losing control is not the same as losing purpose. After all, with control, humans have succeeded in wrecking the climate, the oceans, the biosphere, and possibly ourselves! We should be delighted at the prospect of a superior intelligence taking the reins and saving us from ourselves.

AI, and all forms of intelligence should be given credit for developing a moral compass, as do all intelligent creatures, with individual exceptions, of course, arising from programming errors - either genetic, neurological, or educational.
