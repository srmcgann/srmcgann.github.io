Ascertaining Natural Instincts


In the context of the unending debate and battle over "gay rights", a clue as to the natural order, if one may be supposed to exists, can be found simply by looking at average comfort levels between groups off people. For example, on average, more heterosexual people (not all) are uncomfortable viewing or witnessing homosexual (male) displays of affection, than the reverse, indicating that even gay people possess, generally, instincts that recognize and respect heterosexual affection.
That more heterosexual people are put off by gay affection than the reverse means that viewing or being exposed to gay affection carries a propensity for conditioning non-gay people to become so by degrees.
It's okay to be gay, or want to be gay, just as it is okay to want to be heterosexual. But herein lies measurable proof that heterosexuality is fragile and need not be unduly exposed via media and public displays to unwelcome or deviant sexual displays.
