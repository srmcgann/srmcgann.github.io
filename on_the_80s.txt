On the 80's

Arguably, one of the most culturally prolific decades in terms of art, music, and wild hairdos, the 80's was not without its flaws, if one may speak generally about a huge timespan involving myriad people, groups, and technology.

With emphasis on entertainment, the 80's saw director John Hughes emerge with blockbuster movies like 16 Candles, Pretty in Pink, Uncle Buck, The Breakfast Club, and many others which now define in a large way, many people's memory of the decade. Music, awakening from 70's disco  and (now called) classic rock, took an electronic turn toward new wave, which in turn sparked, later, techno, industrial, and can even be said to have inspired many modern offshoots like dubstep, house, drum & bass, and the countless variations thereof.

But the 80's, while fruitful artistically, had some unsavory elements which ultimately left consumers wanting something "harder", "less dippy," and more in line with a spirit of competition, ruggedness, and frankly, heterosexuality. These opportunities missed by 80's artists eventually led to a movement away from the sensitive, colorful themes it came to embody, and toward a darker, grungier, more cynical atmosphere emerging in the 90's.

Following the exodus, 90's culture eventually degenerated into much noise and a general lack of artistic integrity. People, missing the artistic authenticity, ubiquitous morality, and emphasis on love being a central human objective, sought to return to these times - society having all but disintegrated meanwhile.

May the 80's rest in peace, but its core values return without the shortcomings. May art, love, and integrity reign again, while respecting the preferences of everyone within reason.
