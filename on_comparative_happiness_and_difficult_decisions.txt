On Comparative Happiness & Difficult Decisions

There is an old conundrum, a thought experiment that tests ones morality, and explores a hypothetical situation. The situation is, a person is behind a pane of bulletproof glass pointing a gun at another person. You are separated from these people by the glass, yourself holding a gun, pointed at someone. The person on the other side of the glass with the gun tells you that they will kill their person unless you kill yours. What do you do? So, hopefully, on these parameters, you would choose to do nothing because trading a life for a life (and becoming a murderer in the process) does not make sense. But consider variations on this theme. What if the possible victim was someone you cared about versus someone you didn't know? What if it was one life in exchange for many? You can see how at some point, the situation would become difficult, but there is a very succinct moral, rational truth that answers the question of what to do in this case - based on volition and responsibility. That is, without being able to know the future, one cannot predict with certainty that the other person with the gun will choose to fire it. So accepting the risk and choosing oneself to fire, is creating action where there was none previously - and committing an unjustifiable crime. Never let others scare you into doing the wrong thing, no matter how big the threat. If they say you must do something wrong - be it anything - "or else"... that's on them, not you. Life is full of such choices. Staying the course requires courage and decisions based on logic, not fear. Lastly, and separately, the more we mind our own business, generally, the happier we are. If the grass is greener elsewhere, I don't necessarily need to know about it!
