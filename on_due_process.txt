on due process


An "inverse relationship" describes two things which exist in opposite proportion to each other, such as quality versus quantity, or due process versus rushing something. Due process is vital to anything involving important decisions. It is the dedication to following appropriate steps, in the correct order to arrive at a conclusion or destination. Examples of things which should always involve due process are: justice, science, romance, and many others. In justice, we do not simply decide the fate of the accused based on superficial observation - we investigate, collect evidence and learn about the circumstances so as to establish context, before rushing to judgement. Romance, as well, has due process whereby a couple having established that basic, mutual physical attraction exists, then courts so as to discover, before having babies, whether or not they are compatible as a family. This due process can take from days to years, but generally, the longer something exists, the longer it will probably continue to exist. So too is this true in relationships.

Skipping steps in any process amounts to rushing it, and can have destructive results. Paying respect to the natural requirements of a process sets the results up for success.
