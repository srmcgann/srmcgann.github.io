On Justification and Reason



"The end justifies the means," a famous saying calling into question the ethical/moral latitude of actions underneath a supposedly just umbrella, states that if the result is benevolent, the entire process is justified. This brutal formula is lacking a key consideration, the absence of which renders it incomplete and unable to support any claim of true morality.

The completeness of logic can make or break any formula, and when morality is its basis, the effects can be disastrous for many. Constraints, those things, actions, or behaviors that cannot enter into a formula, defined specifically or in terms of generalities, must cover and prohibit any subpart of a process from transgressing into moral territory which, irrespective of the "ends," cannot independently be justified. So the complete true formula becomes:

"The end justifies, within established constraints, the means."

...thereby burdening the designer with the responsibility to consider wayward, potentially harmful effects caused by their so-called benevolent solution, and for which they must be answerable.
