On Contraception

It is standard dogma to begin drilling into youth, from the very first conversation about "the birds and the bees," to use protection. This guidance, sadly is misguidance. Contraception, or prophylactic, results in, always, a reduction or removal of any need for emotional attachment, which, without risk of pregnancy, involves no reward for becoming emotionally invested in ~this~ person - better to be safe emotionally than possibly hurt, so remaining unattached becomes normal with contraception. Patterns of "serial monogamy" and general failure between lovers march in lockstep between these, and couples who use birth control.

Sex must accompany an understanding that pregnancy is a distinctly possible outcome. If such is unacceptable, then abstinence is the only natural alternative, at the risk of failed relationships, wasted time & energy, broken hearts, and what becomes ultimately, lustful pursuits.

Ours is a society fixated on quantity of life over quality. Women and girls are taught that they have equal roles to men, contrary to nature, and therefore invest decades of their lives gaining education and careers, which in nature, would be time spent as mothers. This disconnect is the basis for why children and families currently have so little quality time, and youth are generally raised without understanding of love, (it being circumvented dually via the absence of mothers and the use of birth control, as described), which results, all of it, in a broken society, broken families, and very unnatural, unhappy lives for those affected.

...

For a variety of legitimate reasons, not every romantic encounter can be expected to last a lifetime or result in the building of a family, but generally such should not be ruled out as a possibility, or else sex becomes a foolish gamble.
